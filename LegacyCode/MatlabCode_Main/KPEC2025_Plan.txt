KPEC 2025 - Smart Community Simulator:

- Current Features:

	- DERS:
		- Solar PV (Not - Controllable)
		- Battery Storage (Controllable)
		- HVAC (Controllable)
		- Controllable Load (Prioritized 8 Level Loads)

	- Controllers:
		- Baseline Off-Grid
		- Rule Based Off-Grid
		
	- Plant Physics:
		- Off-Grid (Considers Startup Power of HVAC)

- Feature Extension:

	- Gymnaesium Wrapper + GitHub Repository

		- Create an organized folder [Done]
		- Setup MATLAB Engine for Python [Done]
		- Improve Off-Grid to incorporate passive PV Control, add Heating Mode, add mode to select if AC turn-on Power matters [Done]
